Project: Parameter Estimation
=============================

This project was created as part of the Computational Physiology module in the `MedTech CoRE 
<http://medtech.org.nz>`_ Doctoral Training Programme. 

This project requires you to put together what you have learned in the tutorials to define a complete workflow which we will use to manually optimise the material properties of a tissue model for use in mechanical simulations.

Outline
-------

You will need to start MAP Client and create a new workflow via the menu item  :menuselection:`File --> New --> Workflow`. This just requires you to select a folder: create a new, empty folder, for example "estimationproject" on the Desktop, and select it.
